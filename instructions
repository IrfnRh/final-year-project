Step 1: Install Dependencies

Open a terminal in the project root folder.

Navigate to the backend folder and install modules:

cd backend
npm install


Navigate to the frontend folder and install modules:

cd ../frontend
npm install


Step 2: Configure Network (Critical)

Find your computer's local IP address (e.g., run ipconfig on Windows or ifconfig on Mac).

Open frontend/App.js.

Update the API_URL constant (around line 10) with your computer's IP address:

const API_URL = 'http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS_HERE:3000';


Example: const API_URL = 'http://192.168.1.15:3000';

Save the file.

Step 3: Start the Backend

Open a terminal in the backend folder.

Run the server:

node server.js


Confirm you see: --- BACKEND SERVER RUNNING ON PORT 3000 ---

Step 4: Start the Frontend (Mobile App)

Open a new terminal in the frontend folder.

Start the Expo server:

npx expo start --clear


Scan the QR code displayed in the terminal using your iPhone camera to load the app in Expo Go.

After that if you go to the client.html and just click login, you can verify and it should take you to the dashboard page. I hope this helps.
